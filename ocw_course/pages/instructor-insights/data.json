  "content":" Instructor Interview Below, Dr. Jeremy Orloff and Dr. Jennifer French Kamrin describe various aspects of how they taught 18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics in spring 2023.\nWhy Teach Probability and Statistics Together?\nA Shift to Active Learning\nLearning and Teaching with R\nUsing the Applets\nIncluding Materials for Teachers\nCurriculum Information Prerequisites 18.02 Multivariable Calculus\nRequirements Satisfied 18.05 can be applied toward a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s or Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Computer Science, but is not required.\n18.05 can be applied toward a Minor in Economics, but is not required.\n18.05 satisfies the Restricted Elective in Science and Technology (MIT General Institute Requirement).\nOffered Every spring semester\nAssessment Reading questions: 5% In-class clicker questions: 5% Eleven problem sets, lowest grade dropped: 25% Midterm exams (12.5% each) and R quiz (5%): 30% Final exam: 30% Student Information Enrollment 37 students\nBreakdown by Year Mostly third- and fourth-year undergraduates\nBreakdown by Major About 50% of the students were Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, most of whom were in either Computer Science and Molecular Biology or Computation and Cognition; another 15% were Biology majors; the remainder represented a range of other fields.\nHow Student Time Was Spent During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:\nLectures (2 hours 40 minutes) Met twice per week for 80 minutes per session; mandatory attendance.\nStudios (50 minutes) Met once per week for 50 minutes per session, working on longer problems that involved the use of R, a computer programming language developed especially for statistical computing.\nOut of Class (8 hours 30 minutes) Outside of class, students completed problem sets and studied for exams.\n"}
