You have the option to enroll if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use the materials without enrolling. The MITx/18.05r content mentioned in this course site are linked to the Open Learning Library.\nListed below are problem sets and solutions. Students in the class were able to work on the assigned problems in the PDF files, then use an interactive problem checker to input each answer into a box and find out if the answer was correct or incorrect. Students could use the problem checker as many times as they wanted to, and they weren’t graded on this in any way. Some of the problem sets use R code and R studios. You can find these materials from R: Information, Tutorials, and Sample Code page.\nProblem set 1 (PDF) Problem set 1 problem checker Problem set 1 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 2 (PDF) Problem set 2 problem checker Problem set 2 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 3 (PDF) Problem set 3 problem checker Problem set 3 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 4 (PDF) Problem set 4 problem checker Problem set 4 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 5 (PDF) Problem set 5 problem checker Problem set 5 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 6 (PDF) Problem set 6 problem checker Problem set 6 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 7 (PDF) Problem set 7 problem checker Problem set 7 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 8 (PDF) Problem set 8 problem checker Problem set 8 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 9 (PDF) Problem set 9 problem checker Problem set 9 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 10 (PDF) Problem set 10 problem checker Problem set 10 solutions (PDF)\nProblem set 11 (PDF) [No problem checker] Problem set 11 solutions (PDF)\n"}
